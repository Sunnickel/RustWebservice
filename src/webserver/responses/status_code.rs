//! # HTTP Status Codes Module
//!
//! This module provides a comprehensive enumeration of HTTP status codes organized by category.
//! It implements standard HTTP/1.1 status codes as defined in RFC 7231 and related specifications.
//!
//! # Categories
//!
//! - **1xx Informational**: Request received, continuing process
//! - **2xx Success**: Request successfully received, understood, and accepted
//! - **3xx Redirection**: Further action needs to be taken to complete the request
//! - **4xx Client Error**: Request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
//! - **5xx Server Error**: Server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use sunweb::StatusCode;
//!
//! // Create a status code
//! let status = StatusCode::Ok;
//! assert_eq!(status.as_u16(), 200);
//! assert_eq!(status.to_string(), "OK");
//!
//! // Compare status codes
//! let not_found = StatusCode::NotFound;
//! assert_eq!(not_found.as_u16(), 404);
//! assert!(!status.equals(not_found));
//!
//! // Use in pattern matching
//! match status {
//!     StatusCode::Ok => println!("Success!"),
//!     StatusCode::NotFound => println!("Not found"),
//!     _ => println!("Other status"),
//! }
//! ```

/// HTTP response status codes enumeration
///
/// Represents all standard HTTP response status codes organized by class.
/// Each variant is explicitly assigned its corresponding numeric value to match
/// the HTTP status code standard defined in RFC 7231 and related RFCs.
///
/// The enum uses `#[repr(u16)]` to ensure each variant corresponds to its
/// standard HTTP status code number.
///
/// # Supported Status Codes
///
/// ## 1xx Informational
/// - `Continue` (100): Initial part of request received, client should continue
/// - `SwitchingProtocols` (101): Server switching protocols per client request
/// - `Processing` (102): WebDAV - request being processed
/// - `EarlyHints` (103): Used to return response headers before final response
///
/// ## 2xx Success
/// - `Ok` (200): Standard response for successful HTTP requests
/// - `Created` (201): Request fulfilled, new resource created
/// - `Accepted` (202): Request accepted for processing
/// - `NoContent` (204): Success with no content to return
/// - And more...
///
/// ## 3xx Redirection
/// - `MovedPermanently` (301): Resource permanently moved
/// - `Found` (302): Resource temporarily moved
/// - `TemporaryRedirect` (307): Temporary redirect maintaining method
/// - And more...
///
/// ## 4xx Client Error
/// - `BadRequest` (400): Server cannot process due to client error
/// - `Unauthorized` (401): Authentication required
/// - `Forbidden` (403): Server refuses to authorize
/// - `NotFound` (404): Resource not found
/// - And more...
///
/// ## 5xx Server Error
/// - `InternalServerError` (500): Generic server error
/// - `BadGateway` (502): Invalid response from upstream server
/// - `ServiceUnavailable` (503): Server temporarily unavailable
/// - And more...
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use sunweb::StatusCode;
///
/// let status = StatusCode::Ok;
/// assert_eq!(status as u16, 200);
///
/// let error = StatusCode::InternalServerError;
/// assert_eq!(error.as_u16(), 500);
/// ```
